/**
 * Keeps a participant's `listenUntil` lease alive for as long as the caller is
 * actually sitting inside room_listen.
 *
 * The bug this exists to kill: `listenUntil` used to be stamped ONCE, at the
 * start of a listen, with the caller's full intended window (up to 270s here).
 * Nothing ever wrote it again — not on early return, not on error, not on
 * process death — so a client that returned after 2s, or died outright, kept
 * reading "Listening" in the room for the rest of that window. Presence was
 * recording intent, not liveness.
 *
 * A lease fixes that without adding any new transport: stamp a SHORT window and
 * keep renewing it. Renewal only happens while the poll loop is genuinely
 * running, so every way a listen can end — return, throw, kill -9 — stops the
 * renewals and the lease lapses on its own within LISTEN_LEASE_MS.
 *
 * `stop()` additionally releases the lease immediately on the paths we can
 * observe (normal return / error), which is the common case and makes the room
 * accurate within one round-trip rather than one lease.
 *
 * @param stamp writes `listenUntil` for this participant; failures are ignored
 *   because presence must never break the listen it is describing.
 * @returns a stop function; call it in a `finally`.
